## Overview

In today's complex world, inundated with countless choices, making informed decisions is more critical than ever. This project introduces a multi-criteria decision analysis tool powered by Python and Streamlit, harnessing the potential of the (fuzzy) TOPSIS method.

**TOPSIS**, or the *Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution*, stands out as a prime method for multi-criteria decision analysis. It is designed to pinpoint the optimal solution among a range of alternatives, keeping multiple criteria or attributes in mind. The core philosophy of TOPSIS lies in spotting solutions that inch closest to the ideal solution while distancing themselves from the anti-ideal or negative-ideal solution.


**Fuzzy TOPSIS** is an extension of the traditional TOPSIS method, incorporating fuzzy logic to handle uncertainty and imprecision in the decision-making process. This approach is particularly useful in situations where decision criteria are not clearly defined or are subject to human judgment and perception, which is often the case in complex decision-making scenarios.

## Features
