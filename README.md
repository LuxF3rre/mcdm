# Multi-Criteria Decision Making

## Overview

In today's complex world, inundated with countless choices, making informed decisions is more critical than ever. This project introduces a multi-criteria decision analysis tool powered by Python and Streamlit, harnessing the potential of the TOPSIS method.

**TOPSIS**, or the *Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution*, stands out as a prime method for multi-criteria decision analysis. It is designed to pinpoint the optimal solution among a range of alternatives, keeping multiple criteria or attributes in mind. The core philosophy of TOPSIS lies in spotting solutions that inch closest to the ideal solution while distancing themselves from the anti-ideal or negative-ideal solution.

## Features

- [x] Built with **Python**.
- [x] Web interface powered by **Streamlit**.
- [x] Implements the **TOPSIS** method for decision making.
